A histogramming library for Rust.

This library aims to provide a similar feature set to C++ [boost-histogram](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_75_0/libs/histogram) but with an idomatic pure-Rust implementation.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ndhistogram = "0.2.0"
```

To get started see the [quick start guide](https://docs.rs/ndhistogram).
